    <p>Luke! Luke! Luke! Hey! Hey! I knew you'd come back! I just knew it! Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the credit and
        take all the reward. Hey, I knew there was more to you than money. Oh, no! Oh, my! Artoo! Can you hear me? Say something!
        You can repair him, can't you? We'll get to work on him right away. You must repair him! Sir, if any of my circuits
        or gears will help, I'll gladly donate them. He'll be all right.

    <p> Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape. Escape is not his plan. I
        must face him alone.

        Lord Vader, I should have known. Only you could be so bold. The Imperial Senate will not sit for this, when they hear you've
        attacked a diplomatic... Don't play games with me, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. You
        passed directly through a restricted system. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want
        to know what happened to the plans they sent you. I don't know what you're talking about. I'm a member of the Imperial
        Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan... You're a part of the Rebel Alliance...and a traitor. Take her away!
    </p>

        Close up formation. You'd better let her loose. Almost there! I can't hold them! It's away! It's a hit! Negative. Negative!
        It didn't go in. It just impacted on the surface. Red Leader, we're right above you. Turn to point... oh-five, we'll
        cover for you. Stay there... I just lost my starboard engine. Get set to make your attack run.

        He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system. He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might
        be able to play back the entire recording. H'm? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take
        this off! Okay. There you go. Well, wait a minute. Where'd she go? Bring her back! Play back the entire message.
        What message? The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards! Luke? Luke! Come to dinner! All right, I'll be right
        there, Aunt Beru. I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter. Well, see what you can do with
        him. I'll be right back. Just you reconsider playing that message for him. No, I don't think he likes you at all.
        No, I don't like you either.</p>
